This project is a conversational chatbot implemented using Python and the Hugging Face Transformers library. It allows users to interact with the bot by asking questions or engaging in conversation. The bot retrieves responses from a predefined set of question-answer pairs stored in a JSON file. If it cannot find a suitable response in the JSON file, it falls back to a pre-trained conversational model provided by Hugging Face. The project also includes a simple web interface built with Flask for users to interact with the bot through a browser. Additionally, the web interface allows users to provide feedback on bot responses. The main tools and technologies used in this project include Python, Flask, Hugging Face Transformers, JSON, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
